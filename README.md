# Forex Analyzer
Tool for forex and stocks fundamental analysis (still being developed).
In it's basic functionality it will present price changing trends and news that might be connected with starting or ending these trends.

## Goals
Analyzer will be able to process stocks or forex prices retrieved from a file or api (like Yahoo finance).
It will look for price changing trends.
Later the application will retrieve financial and political news preceeding trends starting and ending points.
All these results will be saved and available via api enpoint.

## Later goals
Application will take suggestions: which news are really connected with trends. It will 'learn' to filter news by itself.
